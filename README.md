Code stored here will include everything that is needed to create a trading bot

Currently building a trading bot from Scratch 
I will add as many comments as I can to each section to make sure there is full understanding!

This will be getting built on bit after bit after bit.

There are things that I will neeed to research on and change but will get to that when it's time.
Those things include:
 1) Finding out the time openings and closings for each session
 2) The current timezone is based off US timezone, so I need to figure out how to change to UK timezone
